## What is NOSTR?
Nostr is a decentralized communication protocol that stands for “Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays”.
It is designed to provide a censorship-resistant platform for sharing information, allowing users to communicate without the surveillance typically associated with centralized social networks. The protocol operates through a network of users, is open-source, and emphasizes security and freedom of expression. Nostr enables users to share content on a decentralized social network, avoiding the issues of spam, proprietary algorithms, and censorship that are common on traditional platforms. The protocol was first written in 2020 by a Brazilian open source developer known by the pseudonym "fiatjaf".

# Quick Start Guide
## Client 
Clients allow users to interact with the Nostr network. For those unfamiliar with decentralized and/or federated services this means you have a choice in which client to use, similar to the multiple choices of web browsers used to view websites. The following is a list of recommended clients for those new to Nostr. They are selected for their stability and user base.

## List of Clients
Clients are interfaces used by users to interact with Nostr, such as web clients and mobile apps. These clients can connect to multiple relays, which are backend servers that receive, store, and broadcast messages to connected clients. Relays cannot scale and cannot communicate with each other, but they can be chosen by users to connect to.
